# atom-panic-palette-syntax

This is the Panic Palette syntax highlighting ported to the Atom Text editor. This code base has been copied from this repo which seems to have been abandoned. I will try to keep this repo working with the latest Atom releases, but all credit goes to [rteobaldo](https://github.com/rteobaldo) and [heinst](https://github.com/heinst)!
